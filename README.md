# Digital Inclusion Map

An interactive visualization tool for exploring digital inclusion services and feedback across UK postcode districts. The datasets used in this project are synthetic data and do not reflect real services or feedback. 

This project is intended as a provocation for use in design workshops, to facilitate discussion on what features may or may not be useful in such a visualisation. It is NOT a functional tool for exploring digital inclusion services in the UK.

## Overview

This project provides an interactive map interface to visualize and analyze digital inclusion services and user feedback across different postcode districts in the UK. Users can select multiple postcode areas and see word cloud visualizations generated from service descriptions and user feedback for all selected areas.


## Data Sources

The geographical data (postcode district boundaries) is sourced from [uk-postcode-polygons](https://github.com/missinglink/uk-postcode-polygons), which provides UK postcode district and area polygons originally derived from Wikipedia. This data is available under the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

## AI-Assisted Development

This project partially serves as an experiment in AI-assisted code generation, primarily using Cursor and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Wherever possible, the model was used to generate code, with me only stepping in when that approach failed. As a result, the codebase may contain certain idiosyncrasies and poor practices that reflect this development approach. I do not recommend using this approach to develop production-ready code.
